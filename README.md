## Features

> Expected functionality:

-   Create a list of items and display them to look like cards.
-   Use mock APIs to get the data.
-   Keep a delete icon or a button inside each card.
-   When the delete button is pressed, the corresponding card has to be removed from the UI (it's a plus if you use an API. The UI has to be re-arranged on each delete (kudos for using transition/animation)
-   Place new cards in the UI with the click of an add icon or button.
-   Light and Dark mode
